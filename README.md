A lot of people are asking is development goes further, I have to say I'm to short on time to bring this to conclusion for now.
if you are willing to develop the system further and maybe until it can be marketed you can do so and build upon these Files if you obey the license given.
Have fun with it. Maybe I come back to this but it won be very soon.
